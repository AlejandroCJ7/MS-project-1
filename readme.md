My inspiration behind the checkers game goes way back to when i was about 7 years old. Playing checkers always has been a comfort spot in my heart because this is a game i would always play with my grandpa and cousins in mexico. We would play all day with board games, riding horses, and teasing chickens. This will all take place in a 'rancho' and it was basically a farm with a large piece of land filled with corn fields, trees, grass, cows, chickens, and 2 horses. It was a time where everything was so simple and life wasnt stressful and playing checkers just brings back my childhood and a moment to forget about all the chaos in life.

The game is typically played on an 8x8 checkered board, with each player starting with 12 pieces of a specific color, usually red and black. The objective of the game is to capture all of your opponent's pieces or block them in a way that they cannot make any more moves.

The controls for playing Checkers are quite simple. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to play:

1. Decide which player will use the dark-colored pieces (usually black or red)
2. Determine who plays first
3. Players take turns moving their pieces diagonally forward on the dark squares of the board. Regular pieces can only move forward, towards the opponent's side of the board. Each piece can move one square diagonally.
4. If a player's piece lands next to an opponent's piece and there is an empty square diagonally beyond it, the player can "capture" the opponent's piece by jumping over it. The captured piece is removed from the board. 
5. If a regular piece reaches the farthest row on the opponent's side of the board, it gets "crowned" and becomes a "king." Place an additional piece on top of it to indicate its king status. Kings have additional abilities and can move both forward and backward diagonally.
6. Continue moving and capturing: Players take turns moving their pieces and attempting to capture their opponent's pieces. Captures are mandatory if available.
7. The game is over when the opposite player catches all of the other players pieces and a text is displayed as 'red wins' or 'black wins'
